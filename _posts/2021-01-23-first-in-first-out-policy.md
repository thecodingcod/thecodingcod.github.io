> The policy of doing tasks in the same order that they arrive <!--more-->
> is one that we encounter frequently in everyday life:
> from people waiting in line at a theater, to cars waiting
> in line at a toll booth, to tasks waiting to be serviced
> by an application on your computer. One bedrock
> principle of any service policy is the perception
> of fairness. The first idea that comes to mind when
> most people think about fairness is that whoever
> has been waiting the longest should be served first.
> That is precisely the FIFO discipline.
